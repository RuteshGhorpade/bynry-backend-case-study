# Bynry Backend Internship Case Study

Hi! 👋  
This repo contains my submission for the Bynry Backend Intern case study. I’ve broken the solution into three parts as requested — code review, database design, and API implementation. I’ve kept the structure clean and tried to stick to practical,simple and real-world logic.
